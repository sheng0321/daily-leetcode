# 207. Course Schedule

## Problem Description
# 278. [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/ )
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course `b_i` first if you want to take course `a_i`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.
