# 133. Clone Graph
# 278. [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/)
## Problem Description

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val = 1`, the second node with `val = 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

**Examples:**

```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are four nodes in the graph.
- Node 1 has neighbors 2 and 4.
- Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 3.
- Node 3 has neighbors 2 and 4.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1 and 3.

Example 2:
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
- There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
